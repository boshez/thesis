The goal of my thesis is to explore the benefits and limitations in using container-orchestration systems to build and deploy software systems that engage in big data analytics. To perform this exploration, I will be redesigning the Project EPIC software infrastructure as a set of microservices---each inside a separate Docker container---that are deployed on a cluster of cloud-based machines via a container-orchestration system. The current infrastructure was manually deployed on a set of physical machines in a local data center and was not developed using microservices or containerization. My hypothesis is that Iâ€™ll be able to achieve greater scalability and reliability with the new architecture with significantly reduced maintenance costs. I will also explore whether I am able to achieve greater query flexibility and overall performance using this new style of software infrastructure. My specific research questions are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What advantages and/or limitations will the new Project EPIC infrastructure have with respect to its predecessor?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Is it more reliable? If so, why?
		\item Is it more scalable? If so, why?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Does the new infrastructure have lower maintenance costs than the existing infrastructure?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Is it easier to deploy?
		\item Is it easier to upgrade?
		\item Is it more resilient to failures? If so, how?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
