\section{Software development in microservices architectures}

Thanks to container-orchestrated systems and the popularization of container systems, software development is easier. With microservices, focus moves out of one component software architecture to organizing the whole system. Now, we can focus on packaging alone components instead of having to packaging all of them at once, which makes the development more flexible. This would allow for a more continuous development in the system allowing for a better performance optimization, and an easier way to keep the system updated with the last set of technologies.
